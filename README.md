Hi! I'm a masters student in software engineering at UCI, and I like natural language processing, networking, neural networks, and IT automation projects. Here's some of the things I've been working on:

## [Morphologizinator](https://github.com/AdamKeene/morpholigizinator)

A simple NLP toolkit created for a larger project using Grammatical Framework used for modifying the morphology of phrases, extracting clauses from text, and soon translating text using a rule based and statistical hybrid system.

## [Neural Netowrks](https://github.com/AdamKeene/school/tree/main/neural_networks)

Example applications of neural networks to classify text, identify images, and analyze time series data

## [Information Retrieval](https://github.com/AdamKeene/school/tree/main/applied_info_retrieval)

Local search engine built from scratch which processes, indexes, and scores files across large file systems

## [Testing and Debugging](https://github.com/AdamKeene/forge_test_suite)

Java test suite built for a large external project incorporating a variety of testing techniques and a CI/CD platform

## [Baking Show Analysis](https://github.com/AdamKeene/school/tree/main/Baking%20Show%20Project)

Attempting to win the Great British Baking Show using data analytics

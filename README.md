Hi! I'm a masters student in software engineering at UCI, and I like natural language processing, networking, neural networks, and IT automation projects. Here's some of the things I've been working on:

## Morphologizinator

https://github.com/AdamKeene/morpholigizinator

A simple NLP toolkit using Grammatical Framework used for modifying the morphology of phrases, extracting clauses from text, and soon translating text using a rule based and statistical hybrid system.

## Neural-Networks

https://github.com/AdamKeene/school/tree/main/neural_networks

Example applications of neural networks to classify text, identify images, and analyze time series data

## Information-Retrieval

https://github.com/AdamKeene/school/tree/main/applied_info_retrieval

Local search engine built from scratch which processes, indexes, and scores files across large file systems

## Testing-and-Debugging

https://github.com/AdamKeene/forge_test_suite

Java test suite built for a large external project incorporating a variety of testing techniques and a CI/CD platform
